# Figures

This chapter demonstrates the `R` and the `dot` codes that make @sec-main-figure and @sec-suppl-figure shown in the paper.

::: {.callout-note title="R package dependencies"}

You need to install `R` [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) as well as my own publication theme called `theme_Publication` in `_libs`.
```{r fig-init}
#| label: fig-init
#| eval: false
library("ggplot2")
source("static/R/_libs/theme_publish.R")
```
